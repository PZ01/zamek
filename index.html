                        I helped the quality insurance team improve their pipeline by
                        writing <strong>perl scripts</strong> that automated tasks. They later extended my internship and asked me to assist another
                        deparment within the company. I worked with the Flight Simulator team, I helped them by writing a 
                        <strong>cross-platform driver in C++</strong> for controlling
                        the simulation with a joystick. During the feature freeze, I was tasked with fixing bugs in the GUI
                        which was written in <strong>C++ and Qt</strong>. My work helped improve customer satisfaction by fixing most known issues.

                        I had an R&D position at TLT. I was tasked with various work. Most notably, I integrated an H.264 decoder
                        inside of a multimedia framework in <strong>C with ffmpeg</strong>. This allowed us to use high quality streams for product demonstrations.
                        I think it made our product more impressive to clients.

                        Afterwards, I was tasked with adding voice control to our
                        eye-tracking device(see picture). It used the <strong>C# Kinect library</strong>. The product allowed us to register common words,
                        such as <em>off, on, red, stop</em> and trigger functions in our codebase. It was a great way to add another way of
                        interacting with the device; which initially did eye-tracking.

I built the in-game purchase store in <strong>Objective-C</strong> that allows a user to unlock additional features within the app. I was responsible
